Caption make in one html file.

Put in a image, add text to the left/right/top/bottom (top and bottom are a bit buggy right now).

Will save as a png.

Needs internet because it relies on CDNs for external libraries.

Open source, open to pulls forks and etc.

Known bugs:

Does not work on Firefox saddly.
